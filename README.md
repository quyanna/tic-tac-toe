# tic-tac-toe

A Tic-Tac-Toe Game made with HTML/CSS and vanilla JS.

### Notes

TODO:

- Game flow control - ensure game resets on wins
- Front end design
- User prompting
  - Prompt user for name, as well as maybe color and if really fancy maybe a pic?
  - Select if other player (or both players) are humans or CPUs.
